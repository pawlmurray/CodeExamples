MAINTAIN EYE CONTACT is a gamejam game I created with a team during the 2014 Global Game Jam.

The game is pretty strange, like the title suggests the player's goal is to maintain eye contact. The
player must use an xbox 360 wired controller, and controls each eye with one of the analog joysticks.

The player's eyes naturally wander and they  must blink to make things less blurry. Additionally
random events will occur that either distract the player in some way shape or form.

I did almost all of the game design as well as almost all of the coding for the events. 

I've included my favorite piece of code, the one that procedurall generates goats.
