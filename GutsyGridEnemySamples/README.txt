This contains two examples of wildly different enemies in GutsyGrid.

The first enemy type is the horribly named MachineGunEnemy. The MachineGunEnemy has a fairly simple behavior of 
standing still and firing out a stream of projectiles every so often.

The second enemy, GardnerBro, has a more complex behavior. GardnerBro doesn't actually attack by itself, it actually
attacks by creating other enemies.  GardnerBro will move to the frontlines and try to create these extra enemies
(although it can only have two up at a time). 

Lastly SandBag is literally a punching bag that the player can try out different attacks on.
It has a ton of health and doesn't actually do anything.
