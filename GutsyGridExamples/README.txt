GutsyGrid is a side project I worked on for about a year starting in 2012. It's written in C# using the XNA
framework that is sadly no longer supported.

I did almost everything on this project including the programming, game design, and crappy programmer art. It's
by far my biggest side project and one that I'm immensly proud of. When I look back now at a lot of GutsyGrid's 
code I see a lot of mistakes and bad architecture decisions, but the project in itself served as an amazing 
learning opportunity.

The gameplay itself is a hectic action game that mixes in elements from trading card games. Check out some gameplay here
