GutsyGridProceduralMapGenerator
===============================

The vast majority of my code for  procedural map generator I made back in December!

GutsyGrid is a project I worked on for a little over a year. It started out as a pet project because I wanted to learn C#
and XNA but I eventually really fell in love with it. It's highly inspired by the Mega man battle network series
(which I was a huge fan of). Basically it merges elements from action games and collectable card games.
