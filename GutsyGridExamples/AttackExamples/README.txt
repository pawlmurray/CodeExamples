These are some of the attacks the player can use in GutsyGrid. All attacks in GutsyGrid have a base mode and a super mode that grant it additional effects.

All attacks the player can use are CardAttacks so I felt the need to include that here. 

SimpleProjectiles are attacks that move from left to right with only horizontal movement.

SniperShot is a SimpleProjectile that deals more damage the farther it has traveled. In the super mode it pierces through enemies, travels faster, and deals more damage to each enemy hit in a row.

PoisonDart is SimpleProjectile that poisons enemies. In the super mode it consumes all poison on the target it hits, dealing damage based on how many times the target has been poisoned.
